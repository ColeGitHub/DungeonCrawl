## **OVERVIEW**

This is a simple program to practice OOP in c++, and understand how classes interact with eachother, through inheritance or aggregation, as well as practice good design patterns.  At the moment this program runs on the console and doesn't handle keyboard interrupts to move the character.  I have plans to learn QT or another GUI library by moving this program from the console to some other graphical interface.
